Welcome to UBC Open Robotics' documentation for the Robocup@Home Project!
=========================================================================

This is *documentation page* for UBC Open Robotics' Robocup@Home Project. The goal of this project is to create a robot that can compete in the Robocup@Home competition. 
The robot will be able to perform tasks including hosting a party, cleaning the house, and fetching and delivering objects.
More technically speaking, our robot will have such faciliating functions as object recognition, detection and tracking, speech recognition, and autonomous navigation. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

Competition Details
===================

.. _competition-details:

The `RoboCup@Home competition <https://athome.robocup.org/>`_ is an international event that focuses on the 
development of service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications. It is part of the larger RoboCup initiative and is the largest annual competition for autonomous service robots. 
Robots are evaluated through a series of tests in a realistic home environment setting, which assesses their abilities in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction, Navigation, Computer Vision, Object Manipulation, and more.

The most recent rulebook for the competition can be found `here <https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/RuleBook>`_
